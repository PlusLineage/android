How to Build?
-------------

To get started with LineagePlus, you'll need to get familiar with [Source Control Tools](https://source.android.com/setup/develop).

To initialize your local repository using the Lineage+ trees, use a 
command like this:

```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/PlusLineage/android.git -b plus
```
To initialize a shallow clone, which will save even more space & time, use a command like this:

```bash
repo init --depth=1 -u https://github.com/PlusLineage/android.git -b plus
```
Then to sync up:
----------------

```bash
repo sync -c -j$(nproc --all) --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags
```
Finally to build:
-----------------
```bash
lunch_lineage_device-userdebug
```
```bash
brunch device
```
